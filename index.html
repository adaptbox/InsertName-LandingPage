      Fender bender? Scratch? Dents? We’ve all been there before and know how time consuming and
      intimidating it can be to contact body shops for pricing. With [insert name here], simply snap a photo
      of the boo-boo, and we’ll connect you with trusted body shops near you.
    </p>
    <button class="btn btn-default" style='margin: auto; display: block;'>Let me know when [insert name here] launches!</button>
    <p><strong>

    <h2>
      How does it work?:
    </h2>
    <p><strong>Snap. Describe. Choose. Fixed.</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Snap a few photos of the damage from various angles</li>
      <li>Describe the damage including vehicle make, model, plus some contact info</li>
      <li>Choose the quote that best suits you</li>
      <li>Get your car fixed!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That’s it! After we receive the photos and description, we’ll send it off to shops near you for quotes. We
      never share your contact info until you choose a quote. Once connected, you will work directly with the
      body shop to make your car perfect again!

      What's the catch?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a free service to anyone looking to fix their vehicle. We don’t share your contact info and only
      charge a small service fee to the body shop you choose to work with.
